A C# WPF 'Pomodoro Technique' timer. (The technique: https://francescocirillo.com/pages/pomodoro-technique)

A timer application that lets you set timers at intervals of:
- 25min (pomodoro)
- 5min (break)
- 10min (break)
- Custom 

These timers can be started, paused, reset and stopped when time out. 
Timers end with a recurring audio notification to let the user know time is up.
This audio notification can be muted (before or during countdowns) with the 'Mute' checkbox.
